# Windows IoT Facial Recognition Door
Home security systems are a growing field of projects for Makers. A self-built system is not only less expensive than a bulky professional installation, but it also allows for total control and customization to suit your needs. 

With the introduction of Microsoft's Project Oxford, facial recognition applications are now more accessible to makers than ever before. This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi, basic Webcam, and an internet connection to create a door that unlocks itself via facial recognition. If the visitor at the door is recognized, the door will unlock!
